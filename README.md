# socket-squares
Full-stack project which uses web sockets, refresh/access tokens, mongodb, aws, react.
Created during the summer of 2022; I haven't done any work on this recently.
Currently, anyone signed in is able to upload their image to be viewed by all (regardless of signed in), but eventually users will have to bid for this via the website's coin currency.
