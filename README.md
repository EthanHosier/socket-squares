# socket-squares
Full-stack project which uses web sockets, refresh/access tokens for authentication, mongodb, aws, react
Created during the Summer of 2022. I haven't updated this project since then.
Allows signed in users to change the image within a square; this update is then seen by all users on the website.
In the future, I will finish this project and signed-in users will be able to bid for squares.
I hadn't learned bootstrap at the time of this project, hence the css is inefficiently written.
